Simple C Haskell Compiler
=========================

## Why?

I wanted to write a compiler. I like Haskell.

## Why C?

I dont get why bootstraping in such a great idea, if anything it has (some trust problems)[https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf]. If someone spends any time auditing a compiler for a mainstream language that lang will probably be C, if you then trust this codebase you got a trusted Haskell compiler.
